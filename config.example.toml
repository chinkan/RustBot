# Skills are natural-language instructions loaded at startup

# Embedding API for vector search (optional)
# When configured, enables hybrid vector + FTS5 search for memory.
# Without this, falls back to FTS5 keyword search only.

# MCP Server Configurations
# Each [[mcp_servers]] block defines an MCP server to connect to
# The bot will discover and register tools from each server

# Example: Git MCP server (requires uvx/npx)
# [[mcp_servers]]
# name = "git"
# command = "uvx"
# args = ["mcp-server-git"]

# Example: Filesystem MCP server
# [[mcp_servers]]
# name = "filesystem"
# command = "npx"
# args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp/rustbot-sandbox"]

# Example: Web search MCP server with environment variables
# [[mcp_servers]]
# name = "brave-search"
# command = "npx"
# args = ["-y", "@anthropic/mcp-brave-search"]
# [mcp_servers.env]
# BRAVE_API_KEY = "your-brave-api-key"
